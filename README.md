### CS412 Hosted Web Application Final Project

This project was completed as a group in the Fall semester of 2024 at Boston University.
I utilize a *Next.js* framework and a series of API calls to return a guess of a persons Age, Gender, and Nationality (each in its own component) based on an input name.
The entire application was then required to be hosted on *Vercel*!
